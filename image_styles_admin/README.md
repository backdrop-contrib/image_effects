# Image styles admin

## Introduction

The Image styles admin module extends the administrative interface for image
styles by providing additional features.

Currently a duplicate, import and export image style feature are implemented.
More features may be added in the future. These features typically allow you to
more easily handle image styles. It allows us to more easily set up a
test/showcase suite of styles.

Use this module for 1 time export/imports between different sites, "copy &
paste" reuse within a site, and when reporting issues to the Image Effects
issue queue.
