# Image styles admin

## Introduction

The Image styles admin module extends the administrative interface for image
styles by providing a "Duplicate" feature for image styles and making a
slight adjustment to the image style admin overview page (showing details
of the image effects for each style underneath the image style names).

This module has been simplified from the Drupal 7 version, removing the
import/export functionality (since that is available in Backdrop core by
default for image styles).
